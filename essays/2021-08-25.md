Hiya, my name is Alyssia (pronounced uh-li-shuh) and I'm so excited to start the first core MIS class. A little tidbit about me is that I enjoy reading (particularly historical fiction) and hanging out with my two younger brothers in my free time. 

I've found that I really enjoy programming because I love trying to solve problems and because of how logical it can be. There's also nothing more satisfying than spending hours trying to debug a problem (and even dreaming about it) and then finally getting a moment of insight. I'm interested in MIS because I want to discover the more business-oriented aspects of computer science and see if it also "sparks joy" in me. Therefore, I am taking ITM 352 to better see if a career in MIS is a path that I might want to take.
