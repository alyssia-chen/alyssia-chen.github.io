**Overview (including “The problem” and “The solution”)**
When college students register for classes, they may not know what classes to take at the same or what classes to take in general. Although the advisors and colleges provide sample pathways, they may not be the most straightforward or are too general for students who aren't familiar with the classes. Students often rely on their peers to get advice on which culmination of classes to take and which to avoid, but as a freshman you don't know that many people and as a older college student, there are less people that have taken those classes (aka they've graduated) that you can ask advice for. 
A community-based application for students to share exactly which classes they took each semester and their experiences in these classes. By providing a common space for students to talk about their experiences, rate classes, networking opportunities (i.e. clubs), future students will have an easier time deciding what classes or clubs or opportunities to do concurrently.

**Mockup page ideas**
Make your own profile page (which classes you took and a blog about how you felt about it)
Check out other people's pages (filtered by majors)
ask if you should take page
search for classes and see how hard they were for students page

**Use case ideas**
New user goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, sets up profile (classes you took and how you felt per semester)
Admin goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, edits site and moderates people's question.
User goes to landing page, logs in, checks out other students' profiles (possibly using the filtering system to only see students who are doing the same major(s)).

**Beyond the basics**
scraping the rate my profs
Verification of your classes by authorized people
A tutorial on how to navigate the system
Admin has capability to delete non-smart questions

**Notes**
Ask if you don't know
Post if you have a question or want advice
Maybe submit anonymously if you're not comfortable with sharing your classes or grades
Point system to see how honest they were
Clubs
