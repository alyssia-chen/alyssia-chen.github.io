# Overview (including “The problem” and “The solution”)
_The problem:_ When college students register for classes, they may not know what classes to take at the same time or what classes to take in general. Although advisors and colleges provide sample pathways, they may not be the most straightforward or are too general for students who aren't familiar with the classes. Students often rely on their peers to get advice on which combination of classes to take and which to avoid, but as a freshman you don't know that many people and as a older college student, there are less people that have taken those classes that you can ask advice for (aka because they've graduated).

_The solution:_ A community-based application for students to systematically share exactly which classes they took each semester and their experiences in these classes. By providing a common space for students to talk about their experiences, rate various classes and networking opportunities (i.e. clubs) they've taken, future students will have an easier time deciding what classes or clubs or opportunities to do concurrently. By going through other people's profiles, students can create a pathway that's suitable for themselves.

# Approach
Once a profile is created, others can browse the profiles filtered by majors to find similar pathways to mimic. Once a pathway is found, users can save these profiles to refer to later.

# Mockup page ideas
Make your own profile page (which classes you took and a blog about how you felt about it)
Check out other people's pages (filtered by majors)
ask if you should take page
search for classes and see how hard they were for students page

# Use case ideas
New user goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, sets up profile (classes you took and how you felt per semester)
Admin goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, edits site and moderates people's question.
User goes to landing page, logs in, checks out other students' profiles (possibly using the filtering system to only see students who are doing the same major(s)).

# Beyond the basics
scraping the rate my profs
Verification of your classes by authorized people
A tutorial on how to navigate the system
Admin has capability to delete non-smart questions
Students can also set up notifications to find out automatically when a pathway is created that satisfies criteria that they specify.
Capability to share your grades
Capability to share your classes and grades anonymously
Point system for users to rate how good a pathway was
