During the summer, my friend and I decided to do some Leetcode (a website that gives you problems to solve with code) problems together. At the time, the only languages I had been exposed to were Java, C, and C++. Since my most recent experience was with C (a more rudimental and “computery” language), I decided to code in it. On the other hand, my friend had just finished taking ICS 314 so he used Javascript. I remember peeking at his code and seeing statements like `let num = 2;` which sounded baffling to me; it sounded like you’re commanding these lines to allow themselves to exist in your code. 

I didn’t think our different choices in language would make a difference but boy was I wrong. In the beginning, he would be finished with the problem while I was still there trying to figure out where my pointers (a location marker for things in the program–a bane of many people learning C) were located. Although in the end, my C programs were faster than his Javascript programs (an advantage of the C language), I was slowly recognizing the strength in using Javascript. Even when I pivoted to using Java for the Leetcode problems, there were just so many things that my friend could do in Javascript much more easily than I could in Java. 

Fast forward a few semesters, I’m finally taking ICS 314 and after we did this tutorial [google.com], there are some new things I’ve picked up. For example, I finally understand that Javascript treats functions just like any data type (numbers, strings, etc). I’m also getting a better understanding of anonymous functions in that they’re just functions for one-time uses. Lastly, I’m so glad the tutorial included a section about promises because whenever I came upon this in the past, I had no idea what it did. Essentially, it allows your code to come upon a fork in the road and choose a path based on a certain condition. 

In my opinion, Javascript is a good programming language from a software engineering perspective because its flexibility allows for creative programming and allows people to focus on the actual content of their program rather than the syntax.
